Description
------------
AdminCMD is a powerful plug-in that brings you commands that give you total control over your server. 
Now we decided to remake it completely.
Featuring the most widely used commands in server management such as: inventory management, 
banishment of bad players, limitation to teleporting, setting spawn and home way points, and much, much more! 
Blockface approved and rated as one of the best plug-in by server owners.
